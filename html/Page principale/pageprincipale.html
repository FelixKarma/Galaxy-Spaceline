          <li>
            <h2 id="mercury">Mercure</h2>
            <p>
              Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
              Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts
              and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated
              by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees
              below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's
              egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
            <p>
              Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity.
              Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic
              atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The
              scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses
              below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus
              spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="earth">Terre</h2>
            <p>
              Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water -
              and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets,
              plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather,
              but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in
              a way that encourages life - and lots of it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
            <p>
              Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth,
              telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white
              patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright
              and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could
              be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in
              the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in
              1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered
              surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however,
              have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and
              holds many mysteries yet to be solved.

          <li>
            <h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
            <p>
              The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons
              and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar
              system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it
              had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star
              rather than a planet.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="saturn">Saturne</h2>
            <p>
              Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the
              ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and
              helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds
              in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second
              in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with
              heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow
              and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
            <p>
              The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was
              discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh
              planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to
              complete one orbit.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
            <p>
              Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun,
              Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to
              the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth.
              Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet
              Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out
              of every 248 Earth years
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="pluto">Pluton</h2>
            <p>
              Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930
              and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the
              discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto
              was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may
              offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar
              system.
